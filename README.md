## NAME

startup-time - a command-line benchmarking tool which measures the startup times of programs in various languages

## USAGE

```sh
# run all available tests
$ startup-time

# only run the "fast" tests
$ startup-time --only fast

# run all but the "slow" tests
$ startup-time --omit slow

# only run the JVM tests (e.g. Java, Scala etc.)
$ startup-time --only jvm

# only run tests which finish quickly
$ startup-time --only fast --omit slow-compile

# increase the number of times each test is run (default: 10)
$ startup-time --rounds 100
```

## INSTALLATION

```sh
$ gem install startup-time
```

## DESCRIPTION

A command-line tool which measures how long it takes to execute ["Hello, world!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) programs written in various languages. It records the fastest time for each program and prints a sorted table of the times after each run. Apart from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed below, the tool doesn't require any of the tested languages to be installed: if a compiler/interpreter is not available, the test is skipped.

### Why?

To determine which languages are practical (or impractical) to use for command-line interface (CLI) programs. Anything under
[100 milliseconds](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/) is perceived as instantaneous. Anything over that is perceived as delayed, which can tangibly impair productivity and flow, and even risk breaking the user's train of thought.
