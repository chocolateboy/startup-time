## Description

This benchmark game tests how long it takes to execute ["Hello, world!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) programs written in various languages. It records the fastest time for each program and prints a sorted table of the times after each run. With the exception of the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) listed below, it does not require any of the tested languages to be installed: if a compiler/interpreter is not available, the test is skipped.

## Example Output

    Test          Time (ms)
    C (gcc)            0.43

    Rust               0.81
    LuaJIT             1.15
    C++ (g++)          1.44

## Prerequisites

* Ruby >= 1.9.3
* [tty](https://github.com/peter-murach/tty#installation)

## Setup

    gem install tty

## Tasks

### Run the tests

    rake

Or:

    rake rounds=20 # change the number of times each program is executed (default: 10)

### Clean up temporary files

    rake clean

## Contributing

Patches are welcome, but please make sure the test runs without warnings or errors if the compiler/interpreter is not installed. See the Rakefile for examples.
